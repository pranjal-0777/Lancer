
Multithreading
via - Thread class - extends - simpler - direct access to thread - limits  - each task requires new thread instance
via - Runnable interface - more code - indirect access to thread methods
      better object oriented design
      allows class to extend other class
      more flexible for executor framework
      same runnable object can be shared accross multiple thread
