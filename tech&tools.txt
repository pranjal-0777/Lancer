1/ Communication Protocols 
 - TCP (reliable, connection-oriented) vs. UDP (faster, connectionless). 
 + Differences in use cases, performance, and reliability. 
 - Evolution of HTTP (HTTP/1.1 → HTTP/2 → HTTP/3). 
 + Multiplexing, streams, and the role of QUIC in HTTP/3. 
 - Real-time communication protocols: WebSockets, gRPC, raw TCP/UDP. 
 + When to use them (e.g., chat apps, gaming). 

2/ Web Servers 
 - Role of web servers like NGINX, Apache, or custom-built ones. 
 + How they process requests and manage threads/connections. 
 - HTTP protocol configurations (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3). 
 + Performance considerations like multiplexing and persistent connections. 
 - Proxy setups (forward/reverse proxies). 
 + CDN as a reverse proxy and API gateways for backend management. 

3/ Database Engineering 
 - ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). 
 + Why they matter and trade-offs for performance. 
 - Relational vs. Non-relational databases. 
 + Examples: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis for Caching. 
 - Indexing techniques. 
 + B+ Trees, LSM, and query optimization. 

4/ Proxies 
- Explore how proxies improve scalability and security. 
 - Elements to be covered: 
 - Forward proxy vs. Reverse proxy. 
 + Use cases in caching, authentication, and load balancing. 
 - Layer 4 (transport layer) vs. Layer 7 (application layer) proxies. 
 + How they interact with protocols like HTTP and TCP. 
 - Examples of popular proxies: NGINX, HAProxy, Envoy. 


5/ Messaging Systems 
 - Publish-Subscribe model. 
 + Examples: Kafka (long-polling), RabbitMQ (push). 
 - Message delivery guarantees. 
 + At-least-once, exactly-once, at-most-once delivery. 
 - Real-world applications in microservices and event-driven architecture. 

6/ Message Formats 
 - Human-readable formats: JSON, XML. 
 + When to use and their pros/cons. 
 - Binary formats: Protocol Buffers, Avro. 
 + Faster serialization/deserialization for large-scale systems. 

7/ Security 
 - Encryption and secure communication (TLS/SSL). 
 + Preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. 
 - Common vulnerabilities: 
 + XSS, SQL injection, and how to mitigate them. 
 - DDOS prevention techniques. 
 + Use of firewalls and layer 7 DDOS protection tools like Cloudflare. 

8/ Load Balancing and Scaling 
 - Load balancing techniques. 
 + Round-robin, weighted load balancing, least connections. 
 - Horizontal vs. vertical scaling. 
 + Pros/cons and real-world scenarios. 
 - Autoscaling in cloud environments. 
 + AWS, GCP, and Azure implementations. 
9/ Monitoring and Observability 
 - Log management and analysis. 
 + Tools: ELK stack, Splunk. 
 - Metrics collection and visualization. 
 + Tools: Prometheus, Grafana. 
 - Tracing distributed systems. 
 + Tools: Jaeger, OpenTelemetry. 

10/ Frameworks and Tools 
 - Backend frameworks like Django, Express, Spring Boot. 
 + How to choose based on the project. 
 - Utility tools for debugging, deployment, and testing. 
 + Examples: Postman (API testing), Docker (containerization), Kubernetes (orchestration).
